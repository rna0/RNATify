The Marriage of Figaro - Mozart
The overture is in the key of D major;
 the tempo marking is presto;
 i.e. very fast. The work is 
well known and often played 
independently as a concert piece.
The Marriage of Figaro is scored for 
two flutes, two oboes, two clarinets,
 two bassoons, two horns, two trumpets,
 timpani, and strings; the recitativi
 secchi are accompanied by a keyboard
 instrument, usually a fortepiano or a
 harpsichord, often joined by a cello.
 The instrumentation of the recitativi
 secchi is not given in the score, so 
it is up to the conductor and the performers.
 A typical performance usually lasts around 3 hours.
