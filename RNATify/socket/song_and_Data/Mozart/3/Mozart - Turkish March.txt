Turkish March - Mozart
The last movement, marked Alla turca,
 popularly known as the "Turkish Rondo"
 or "Turkish March", is often heard on 
its own and is one of Mozart's best-known
 piano pieces. Mozart himself titled the
 rondo "Alla turca".[3] It imitates the
 sound of Turkish Janissary bands, the
 music of which was much in vogue at that
 time.[4] Various other works of the time
 imitate this Turkish style, including Mozart's
 own opera Die Entf?hrung aus dem Serail.
 In Mozart's time, the last movement was sometimes
 performed on pianos built with a "Turkish stop",
 allowing it to be embellished with extra percussion effects.

The third movement is a rondo in the form
 A–B–C–D–E–C–A–B–C–coda, with each section
 (except the coda) being repeated.

Section A: This section, in A minor, consists 
of a rising sixteenth-note melody followed by 
a falling eighth note melody over a staccato 
eighth-note accompaniment. It is eight measures long.

Section B: This section introduces new material 
in a melody in thirds and eighth notes before 
varying the A section with a crescendo before 
falling back to piano.

Section C: A forte march in octaves over an 
arpeggiated chord accompaniment. The key changes to A major.

Section D: A piano continuous sixteenth note 
melody over a broken-chord accompaniment. 
This section is in F? minor.

Section E: A forte scale-like theme 
followed by a modification of section D.

Coda: A forte theme consisting mostly of 
chords (arpeggiated and not) and octaves. 
There is a brief piano restatement of the 
theme in the middle of the coda. The movement 
ends with alternating A and C? octaves followed 
by two A-major chords.
