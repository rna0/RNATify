The chords begin piano on a rocking rhythm in 12
8, intercut with quarter rests, which will be reprised 
by the choir after two measures, on Lacrimosa dies illa
 ("This tearful day"). Then, after two measures, the sopranos
 begin a diatonic progression, in disjointed eighth-notes on
 the text resurget ("will be reborn"), then legato and chromatic
 on a powerful crescendo. The choir is forte by m. 8, as which
 point Mozart's contribution to the movement is interrupted by his death.

S?ssmayr brings the choir to a reference of the Introit and 
ends on an Amen cadence. Discovery of a fragmentary Amen fugue
 in Mozart's hand has led to speculation that it may have been
 intended for the Requiem. Indeed, many modern completions 
(such as Levin's) complete Mozart's fragment. Some sections 
of this movement are quoted in the Requiem mass of Franz von 
Supp?, who was a great admirer of Mozart.
