Jo Cohen & Sex Whales - Run Away (feat. Lusil)

Run away, run away
And I know, and I know, and I know
Run away now

We can change anything, and make it better together
Now we're strong, don't question it
The truth will break your chains
We have the key
Open your eyes and see
We are the ones that know the answers
And they ain't never gonna hold us back
The sea that's stretching like the dancers
Imagine life without a purpose
Now picture everything you're fighting for
Now picture everything you're fight for
Now picture everything you're fight for
Run away, run away
And time will find a place that we call home
Break a chain, anything
We'll make it better together now
Don't be afraid of letting go I know there's more we can be free
Open your eyes and see
We are the ones that know the
answers
And they ain't never gonna hold us back
The sea that's stretching like the dancers
Imagine life without a purpose
Now picture everything you're fighting for
Now picture everything you're fight for
Now picture everything you're fight for
