Brandon Jonak & Pep.B - Where Do I Go (feat. Ezra James)

I use to walk these roads with you
Can't remember the last time I went without you
Where do I go, where do I go?

How will I know, how will I know?
I use to walk these roads with you
Can't remember the last time I went without you
Where do I go?
Where do I go from here?
Where do I go?
Where do I go from here?
(I use to walk these roads with you)
(Can't remember the last time I went without you)
I use to walk these roads with you
Can't remember the last time I went without you
Where do I go, where do I go?
How will I know, how will I know?
I use to walk these roads with you
Can't remember the last time I went without you
Where do I go?
Where do I go from here?
Where do I go?
Where do I go from here?
Where do I go, where do I go?
How will I know, how will I know?
I use to walk these roads with you
Can't remember the last time I went without you
Where do I go?
Where do I go from here?
Where do I go?
