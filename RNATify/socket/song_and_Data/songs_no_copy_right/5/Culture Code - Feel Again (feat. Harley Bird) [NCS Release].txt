Culture Code - Feel Again (feat. Harley Bird) [NCS Release]

I recall the past again, tonight
It's in the front of my mind
As we fall apart
You began to cry
The tears are making you blind
The future's far away, but I will stay
I will stay
Just take a leap of faith
We'll find a way, for you and me
Can't look back, can't run
From what I feel inside
There's no more time to
Because I.
I Feel Again
I, I Feel Again, oh now
I, I Feel Again
We're bringing this back to life
(I Feel Again, I Feel it Again, oh now)
I Feel it Again
I Feel it Again
I Feel Again
We're bringing this back to life
Help me find the right words to say


To get us back on our way
Can we try to fight against the grain, I've thrown out what we made
The future's far away, but I will stay
I will stay
Because I.
I Feel Again
I, I Feel Again, oh now
I, I Feel Again
We're bringing this back to life
We're picking up where we left
Off and on again
We never quite could forget
Cause what we got is so intense
(I Feel Again, I Feel it Again, oh now)
I Feel it Again
I Feel it Again
I Feel Again
We're bringing this back to life!
