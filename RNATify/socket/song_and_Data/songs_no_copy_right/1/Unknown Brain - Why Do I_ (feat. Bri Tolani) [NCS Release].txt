Unknown Brain - Why Do I? (feat. Bri Tolani) [NCS Release]
Messing with my head again
You had your heart set on  me
But these feelings they come and go
And they come so easily

Tell me what it is
About you that I can't forget
But you're breaking down my walls again
Just to set me free

Why do I, baby, why do I
Love the way you only always leave me
Why do I, baby, why do I
Love the touch but never love the feeling
Why do I, baby, why do I
Love the way you only always leave me
Why do I, baby, why do I
Love the touch but never love the feeling

Staying up when I go out
You gotta know I'm all yours
But when I say what's that about
You start slurring your words

Tell me why you have to seem so
Distant when I'm holding you
Your fingertips are drifting away
And I f*cking love how it hurts

Why do I, baby, why do I
Love the way you only always leave me
Why do I, baby, why do I
Love the touch but never love the feeling
Why do I, baby, why do I
Love the way you only always leave me
Why do I, baby, why do I
Love the touch but never love the feeling

Why do I, baby, why do I
Why do I, baby, why do I
Why do I, baby, why do I
Love the touch but never love the feeling
