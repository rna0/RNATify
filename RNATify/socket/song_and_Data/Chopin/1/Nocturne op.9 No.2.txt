Chopin composed his popular Nocturne
 in E-flat major, Op. 9, No. 2 when
 he was about twenty.

This popular nocturne is in rounded
 binary form (A, A, B, A, B, A) with
 coda, C. The A and B sections become
 increasingly ornamented with each
 recurrence. The penultimate bar
 utilizes considerable rhythmic
 freedom, indicated by the instruction,
 senza tempo (without tempo).
 Nocturne in E-flat major opens with
 a legato melody, mostly played piano,
 containing graceful upward leaps which
 becomes increasingly wide as the line
 unfolds. This melody is heard again
 three times during the piece. With
 each repetition, it is varied by
 ever more elaborate decorative
 tones and trills. The nocturne
 also includes a subordinate melody,
 which is played with rubato.
