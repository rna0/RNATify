Mariage d'amour 
(English: Marriage of Love) 
is a piece of French solo piano 
music, composed by Paul de 
Senneville in 1979, and first 
performed by the pianist Richard 
Clayderman from his album 
"Lettre A Ma Mare" in 1979. 
Later, pianist George Davidson 
performed this piece of music from 
his album "My Heart Will Go On" 
with a slightly different version. 
This version is sometimes erroneously 
attributed to Fradaric Chopin as 
"Spring Waltz" because of an upload 
on YouTube with the wrong title, which 
had reached over 34 million views 
before finally being removed. 
As of May 2018, several new copies 
with that erroneous title are 
available on YouTube, and one of them 
has reached over 30 million views.
