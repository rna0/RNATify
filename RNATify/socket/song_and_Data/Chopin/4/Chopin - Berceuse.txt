Frederic Chopin's 
Berceuse Op. 57 (1843–44) 
is a lullaby to be played on piano.
 It consists of variations in 
D-flat major. At first the composer 
titled the work Variations, 
but the title was altered for 
publication to the current Berceuse.

It was first published by 
J. Meissonnier of Paris in 1844 
and dedicated to Elise Gavard 
(1824–1900).
The music begins and ends in 6/8 time. 
'Berceuse' literally means 
"cradle song". Its style has been 
described as impressionistic.
